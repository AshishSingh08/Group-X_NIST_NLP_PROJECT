Automated Information Extraction from NIST Databases Using NLP Techniques

Implement the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Database with help of
NLP model/methodology and extract information such as: type of environments/operating
system, Attacks vectors cast-off, pre-requisites input and potential output etc.
(https://www.nist.gov/) To extract information from the NIST database involves several steps
such as, including data retrieval, preprocessing, NLP model, and information extraction.
Steps to Implement the NIST Database Information Extraction:
1. Data Retrieval: Access the NIST database, which may involve web scraping or API
usage to gather the required documents.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, removing
stop words, and normalizing the text.
3. Model: NLP model to recognize and extract relevant information such as environments,
operating systems, attack vectors, prerequisites, and potential outputs.
  Machine Learning models implemented: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
  Natural Language Processing models implemented: HMM, MEMM, CRF, Transformer based models, BERT, T5
5. Information Extraction: Use the appropriate NLP model to extract specific
information from the documents.
6. Post-processing and Presentation: Format the extracted information for easy
interpretation and use.
